<p>
  The first Internet Explorer was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">NCSA</a>, but since NCSA was a public entity it relied
  on Spyglass as its commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of the Mosaic browser to
  Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on
  the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the Spyglass, not the NCSA source code. The license to
  Microsoft provided Spyglass (and thus NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft's revenues for the
  software.

  In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8
  offered better support for web standards than previous versions, with plans for improved support for RSS, CSS, and
  Ajax, as well as full compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It was also the first version to successfully pass
  the Acid2 test. In addition, Internet Explorer 8 included new features such as WebSlices and an improved phishing
  filter.
